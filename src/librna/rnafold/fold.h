/**
 *  \brief Compute minimum free energy and an appropriate secondary
 *  structure of an RNA sequence
 *
 *  The first parameter given, the RNA sequence, must be \a uppercase and should only contain
 *  an alphabet \f$\Sigma\f$ that is understood by the RNAlib\n
 *  (e.g. \f$ \Sigma = \{A,U,C,G\} \f$)\n
 *
 *  The second parameter, \a structure, must always point to an allocated
 *  block of memory with a size of at least \f$\mathrm{strlen}(\mathrm{sequence})+1\f$
 *
 *  If the third parameter is NULL, global model detail settings are assumed for the folding
 *  recursions. Otherwise, the provided parameters are used.
 *
 *  The fourth parameter indicates whether a secondary structure constraint in enhanced dot-bracket
 *  notation is passed through the structure parameter or not. If so, the characters " | x < > " are
 *  recognized to mark bases that are paired, unpaired, paired upstream, or downstream, respectively.
 *  Matching brackets " ( ) " denote base pairs, dots "." are used for unconstrained bases.
 *
 *  To indicate that the RNA sequence is circular and thus has to be post-processed, set the last
 *  parameter to non-zero
 *
 *  After a successful call of fold_par(), a backtracked secondary structure (in dot-bracket notation)
 *  that exhibits the minimum of free energy will be written to the memory \a structure is pointing to.
 *  The function returns the minimum of free energy for any fold of the sequence given.
 *
 *  \note OpenMP: Passing NULL to the 'parameters' argument involves access to several global model
 *        detail variables and thus is not to be considered threadsafe
 *
 *  \see fold(), #model_detailsT, set_energy_model(), get_scaled_parameters()
 *
 *  \param sequence       RNA sequence
 *  \param structure      A pointer to the character array where the
 *                        secondary structure in dot-bracket notation will be written to
 *  \param parameters     A data structure containing the prescaled energy contributions
 *                        and the model details. (NULL may be passed, see OpenMP notes above)
 *  \return the minimum free energy (MFE) in kcal/mol
