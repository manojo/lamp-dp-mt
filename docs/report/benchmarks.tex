\section{Benchmarks} \label{benchmarks}
In an attempt to provide realistic benchmarks, we tried to gather related implementations. The authors of \cite{gpu_atlp} did not respond to our multiple solicitations. The authors of \cite{swat_mega} were very friendly and provided us their source code. Unfortunately, since they address a different category of problem (they focus on huge serial problems whereas we focus on smaller non-serial problems) their implementation might be biased towards large sequences that our implementation cannot address. Finally, we asked lately the authors of \cite{gpu_rnafold} who did not respond either to our sollicitations.

We organize the benchmarks as follow: if we have at our disposal a working implementation that could be run on our evaluation platform, we use it, otherwise, we refer to the related paper and rescale the result according to the memory throughput and computation throughput of the related device so that we can have a good approximation of how they could compare.

\subsection{Metrics}
The main metrix of interest is the running time. In an attempt to reduce the variance, we run 20 consecutive test and take the median running time (since median is less sensitive to outlier than the average).

As the device memory is quite limited, it seems interesting to also take into account the space usage. The space requirement limits the maximal size of addressable problems  on a particular hardware. This might be a concern for large problems, because they would require special adaptation to handle such cases both correctly and efficiently. However, simple solutions like using a device with larger memory or using main memory (if a $5\times$ slowdown is still acceptable) could solve this issue.

\subsection{Benchmarking platform}
Our benchmarking platform is a notebook with a Core i7-3720QM, 16Gb or main memory and an NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M running under MacOS X 10.8. Tests are made when the discrete GPU is not involved in rendering the user interface\footnote{This involves a workaround to keep the discrete GPU powered, while the CPU is involved in rendering graphics; source code available on demand.}. Due to impossibility to disable the watchdog timer in MacOS, CUDA kernels are limited to few seconds of running time before they are automatically aborted.
