\section{Problems classification}
\subsection{Definitions}\ul
\item \textbf{Dimensions:} let $n$ the size of the input and $d$ the dimension of the underlying matrix.
\item \textbf{Matrices:} we refer indifferently by the matrix or the matrices to all the intermediate cost- and backtrack-related informations that are necessary to solve the dynamic programming problem of interest. Matrices elements are usually denoted by $M_{(i,j)}$ ($i^{\rm th}$ line , $j^{\rm th}$ column).
\item \textbf{Computation block:} this is a part of the DP matrix (cost and or backtrack) that we want to compute. A block might be either a sub-matrix (rectangular) or a parallelogram, possibly cropped at its parent matrix boundaries.
\item \textbf{Wavefront:} the wavefront consists of all the data necessary to reconstruct a computation block of the DP matrix. It might include some previous lines/columns/diagonals as well as line-/column-/diagonal-wise aggregations (min, max, sum, ...).
\item \textbf{Delay:} we call delay the maximum distance between an element and its dependencies along column and lines (ex: recurrence $M_{(i,j)}=f\big(M_{(i-1,j)}, M_{(i-2,j-1)}\big)$ has delay 3).
\ule

\subsection{Classification}
\subsubsection{Litterature classification}
In the literature, dynamic programming problems (DP) are classified according to two criteria:\ul
\item \textbf{Monadic/polyadic:} a problem is monadic when only one of the previously computed term appears in the right hand-side of the recurrence formula (ex: Smith-Waterman). When two or more terms appear, the problem is polyadic (ex: Fibonacci, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$).
When a problem is polyadic with index $p$, it also means that its backtracking forms a $p$-ary tree (where each node has at most $p$ children).

\item \textbf{Serial/non-serial:} a problem is serial ($s=0$) when the solutions depends on a fixed number of previous solutions (ex: Fibonacci), otherwise it is said to be non-serial ($s\ge 1$), as the number of dependencies grows with the size of the subproblem. That is computing an element of the matrix would require $O(n^s)$.  (ex: Smith-Waterman with arbitrary gap is $s=1$; we can usually infer $s$ from the number of bound variables in the recurrence formula)
	\[M_{(i,j)}=\max\left\{\begin{array}{l} ... \\ M_{(i,j-1)}\\ \max\limits_{i<k<j} [ M_{(i,k)}+M_{(k+1,j)} ] \end{array}\right. \]
\ule

Note that the algorithmic complexity of a problem is exactly $O\big(n^{d+s}\big)$.

\subsubsection{Calculus simplifications}
In some special case, it is possible to transform a non-serial problem into a serial problem, if we can embed the non-serial term into an additional aggregation matrix. For example:
	\[M_{(i,j)}=\max\left\{\begin{array}{l} \max\limits_{k<i} M_{(k,j)}
	\\ \sum\limits_{k<i, l<j}M_{(k,l)} \end{array}\right.
	\implies M_{(i,j)}=\max\left\{\begin{array}{l} C_{(k,j)} \\ A_{(i-1,j-1)} \end{array}\right.\]
Where the matrix $C$ stores the maximum along the column and matrix $A$ stores the sum of the array of the previous elements. Both can be easily computed with an additional recurrence:
	\[\begin{array}{rcl} C_{(i,j)}&=&\max(C_{(i-1,j)}, M_{(i,j)}) \\
	A_{(i,j)}&=&A_{(i-1,j)}+A_{(i,j-1)}-A_{(i-1,j-1)}+M_{(i,j)}\end{array}\]

Although this simplification removes some non-serial dependencies at the cost of extra storage in the wavefront, it is not sufficient to transform all non-serial monadic problems into serial problems (ex: this does not apply to Smith-Waterman with arbitrary gap cost).

% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Problems of interest}
We usually focus on problem that have an underlying bi-dimensional matrix ($d=2$) because they can be parallelized (as opposed to be serial if $d=1$) and can solve large problems (of size $n$). Problems of higher matrix dimensionality ($d\ge3$) require substantial memory which severely impacts their scalability. Also we tend to limit algorithmic complexity of the problems as from $O(n^4)$ on, running time becomes a severely limiting factor.

We describe problems structures: inputs, cost matrices and backtracking matrix. These all have an alphabet (that must be bounded in terms of bit-size). Unless otherwise specified, we adopt the following conventions:\ul
\item Matrices dimensions are implicitly specified by number of indices and their number of elements is usually the same as the input length.
\item Number are all unsigned integers
\item Problem dimension is $m,n$ (or $n$) indices $i,j$ ranges are respectively $0\le i<m$, $0\le j<n$.
\item Unless otherwise specified, the recurrence applies to all non-initialized matrix elements.
\ule
We describe the problem processing in terms of both initialization and recurrences.

\subsection{Smith-Waterman (simple)}\label{sswat}\ol
\item Problem: matching two strings $S$, $T$ with $|S_{\rm padded}|=m, |T_{\rm padded}|=n$.
\item Matrices: $M_{m \times n}, B_{m \times n}$
\item Alphabets:\ul
	\item Input: $\Sigma(S)=\Sigma(T)=\{a,c,g,t\}$.
	\item Cost matrix: $\Sigma(M) = [0..z], z=\max({\rm cost(\_)}) \cdot \min(m,n)$
	\item Backtrack matrix: $\Sigma(B)=\{stop,W,N,NW\}$
	\ule
\item Initialization:\ul
	\item Cost matrix: $M_{(i,0)}=M_{(0,j)}=0$.
	\item Backtrack matrix: $B_{(i,0)}=B_{(0,j)}=stop$.
	\ule
\item Recurrence: \[M_{(i,j)}=\max\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
		0 & stop\\
		M_{(i-1,j-1)}+{\rm cost}(S(i),T(j)) & NW\\
		M_{(i-1,j)}-d & N\\
		M_{(i,j-1)}-d & W
	\end{array}\right\}=B_{(i,j)} \]

\item Backtracking: starts from the cell $\max \{M_{(m,j)} \cup M_{(i,n)}\}$, stops at
the first cell containing a $0$.
\item Visualization: by convention, we put the longest string vertically ($m\ge n$):
\begin{center}\setlength{\unitlength}{.6cm}\begin{picture}(8,9)
	\put(-.5,7.5){S}\put(-.35,7.4){\linethickness{1pt}\vector(0,-1){2}}

	\Cd[1,0]{5,4}{0.8}
	\Cd[1,-1]{5,5}{0.8}
\Cm\end{picture}\end{center}

\item Optimizations:\ul
	\item In serial (monadic) problems we can avoid building the matrix $M$ by only maintaining the 3 last diagonals in memory (one for the diagonal element, one for horizontal/vertical, and one being built). This construction extends easily to polyadic problems where we need to maintain $k+2$ diagonals in memory where $k$ is the maximum backward lookup.
	\item Padding: since first line and column of the matrix are zeroes, their initialization might be omitted, but this would implies more involved initialization and computations, which is cumbersome. Also since to fill the $i^{\rm th}$ row we refer to the $(i-1)^{\rm th}$ character of string $S$ thus we prepend to both $S$ and $T$ an unused character, so that matrix and input lines are aligned. Hence valid input indices are $S[1 \cdots m-1]$ and $T[1 \cdots n-1]$. We refer as such strings as padded strings hereafter (with $|S_{\rm padded}| = |S| + 1$).

\subsection{Smith-Waterman with affine gap extension cost}\ol
\item Problem: matching two strings $S$, $T$ with $|S_{\rm padded}|=m, |T_{\rm padded}|=n$.
\item Matrices: $M_{m \times n}, E_{m \times n}, F_{m \times n}, B_{m \times n}$
\item Alphabets:\ul
	\item Input: $\Sigma(S)=\Sigma(T)=\{a,c,g,t\}$.
	\item Cost matrices: $\Sigma(M) = \Sigma(E) = \Sigma(F) = [0..z], z=\max({\rm cost(\_)}) \cdot \min(m,n)$
	\item Backtrack matrix: $\Sigma(B)=\{stop,W,N,NW\}$
	\ule
\item Initialization:\ul
	\item No gap cost matrix: $M_{(i,0)}=M_{(0,j)}=0$.
	\item T-gap extension cost matrix: $E_{(i,0)}= 0$ \textit{<<eat S chars only>>}
	\item S-gap extension cost matrix: $F_{(0,j)}= 0$
	\item Backtrack matrix: $B_{(i,0)}=B_{(0,j)}=stop$.
	\ule
\item Recurrence for the cost matrices:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
M_{(i,j)}&=&\max\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	0 & stop\\
	M_{(i-1,j-1)}+{\rm cost}(S(i),T(j)) & NW\\
	E_{(i,j)} & N\\
	F_{(i,j)} & W
\end{array}\right\}=B_{(i,j)}\\
\\
E_{(i,j)}&=&\max\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	M_{(i, j-1)} - \alpha & NW\\
	E_{(i,j-1)} - \beta & N\\
\end{array}\right\}=B_{(i,j)}\\
\\
F_{(i,j)}&=&\max\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	M_{(i-1,j)} - \alpha & NW\\
	F_{(i-1,j)} - \beta & W\\
\end{array}\right\}=B_{(i,j)}
\end{array}\]

That can be written alternatively as:
\[M_{(i,j)}=\max\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	0 & stop\\
	M_{(i-1,j-1)}+{\rm cost}(S(i),T(j)) & NW\\
	\max_{1 \le k \le j-1} M_{(i,k)} - \alpha - (j-1-k) \cdot \beta & N\\
	\max_{1 \le k \le i-1} M_{(k,j)} - \alpha - (i-1-k) \cdot \beta & W\\
\end{array}\right\}=B_{(i,j)} \]

Although the latter notation seems more explicit, it introduces non-serial dependencies that the former set of recurrences is free of. So we need to implement the former rules whose kernel is 
\[ [M;E;F]_{(i,j)} = f_{\rm kernel} ( [M;E]_{(i,j-1)}, [M;F]_{(i-1,j)}, M_{(i-1,j-1)} ) \]
Notice that this recurrence is very similar to \nameref{sswat} except that we propagate 3 values ($M,E,F$) instead of a single one ($M$). Also notice that it is possible to propagate $E$ and $F$ inside a resp. horizontal and vertical wavefront.

\subsection{Smith-Waterman with arbitrary gap cost}\label{aswat}\ol
\item Problem: matching two strings $S$, $T$ with $|S_{\rm padded}|=m, |T_{\rm padded}|=n$ with an arbitrary gap function $g(x)\ge 0$ where $x$ is the size of the gap. Without loss of generality, let $m\ge n$\footnote{Otherwise if $|T|>|N|$ we only need to swap both the inputs and backtracking pairs.}. Example penalty function could be\footnote{Intuition: long gaps penalize less, at some point, one large gap is better than matching and smaller gaps.} $g(x)=m-x$.
\item Matrices: $M_{m \times n}, B_{m \times n \times m}$
\item Alphabets:\ul
	\item Input: $\Sigma(S)=\Sigma(T)=\{a,c,g,t\}$.

\subsection{Convex polygon triangulation}\ol
\item Problem: triangulating a polygon of $n$ vertices with least total cost for added edges. We denote the cost of adding an edge between the  pair of edges $i,j$ by $S(i,j)$, Where $S_{n \times n}$ is a lower triangular matrix compacted in memory (rows are contiguous) with a 0 diagonal that is omitted \footnote{Arbitrary convention for both architectural implementation and code generator. Rationale: in lower triangular matrix, element address is independent of the matrix size.}, hence $|S|=\tfrac{n^2}{2}=N$.

\item Matrices: $M_{n\times 2n}, B_{n \times 2n}$ \textit{<<first edge, last edge>>} upper triangular including main diagonal 
\item Alphabets:\ul
	\item Input: $\Sigma(S_{(i,j)})=\{0..m\}$ with $m=\max_S(i,j) \forall i,j$ determined at runtime\footnote{We need to scan/have stats about $S$ and that's where LMS plays a role}.
	\item Cost matrix: $\Sigma(M)=\{0..z\}$ with $z = m \cdot (n-2)$ (we add at most $n-2$ edges).
	\item Backtrack matrix: $\Sigma(B)=\{stop, 0..n\}$ (the index of the edge we add)
	\ule
\item Initialization: $M_{(i,i)}=0, M_{(i,i+1)}=0, B_{(i,i)}=stop \quad\forall i$

\item Recurrence: \[M_{(i,j)}=\left\{ S(i,j) + \max_{i<k<j}M_{(i,k)}+M_{(k,j)} \,\,\rule[-.75em]{.5pt}{2em}\,\,  k \right\} = B_{(i,j)} \]
	It is interesting to note that even in the sequential world, this problem is solved 
	by filling the diagonals, ie. computing sub-solutions for all polygons of size $k$ before
	those of size $k+1$.

\item Backtracking: Start at $B_{(1,n)}$. Use the following recursive function for the smaller polygons:
	\[{\rm BT}(B_{(i,j)}=k) \mapsto \left\{\begin{array}{ll} A_i & \text{if } k=0 \lor k=j \\
		\Big( {\rm BT}(B_{(i,k)}) \Big) \cdot \Big( {\rm BT}(B_{(k+1,j)}) \Big) & \text{otherwise} \end{array}\right.\]

\item Visualization: the layout is the a matrix of size $n \times (2n-2)$, because of polygons being 
"cyclical" in nature.

	\item Backtrack matrices: $BW_{(i,i)}=BV_{(i,i)}=BF_{(0)}=stop$.
	\ule
\item Recurrence:
\[\begin{array}{rcl}
W_{(i,j)}&=&\min\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	W_{(i+1,j)}+b & S\\
	W_{(i,j-1)}+b & W\\
	V_{(i,j)}+\delta(S_i,S_j) & V \\
	\min_{i<k<j}W_{(i,k)}+W_{(k+1,j)} &k
\end{array}\right\} = BW_{(i,j)}\\
\\
V_{(i,j)}&=&\min\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	\infty \qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad {\rm if}(S_i,S_j) \text{ is not a base pair} & stop\\\\
	eh(i,j)+b \qquad\qquad\, \text{otherwise} & HL\\
	V_{(i+1,j-1)}+es(i,j) & IL \\
	VBI_{(i,j)} & (i',j') \\
	\min_{i<k<j-1}\{W_{(i+1,k)}+W_{(k+1,j-1)}\} +c & k
\end{array}\right\} = BV_{(i,j)}\\
\\
F_{(j)}&=&\min\left\{\begin{array}{l|l}
	F_{(j-1)} & L \\ 
	\min_{1\le i< j} (F_{(i-1)} + V_{(i,j)}) & i
\end{array}\right\} = BF_{(j)}\\
\\
VBI_{(i,j)}&=&\min\Big\{\min_{i<i'<j'<j}V_{(i',j')}+ebi(i,j,i',j')\} +c \,\,\Big|\,\, (i',j') \Big\}=BV_{(i,j)}
\end{array}\]

In practice, we don't go backward for larger values than 30, so we can replace $\min_{i<k<j}$ by $\min_{\max(i,j-30)<k<j}$ in the expressions of $VBI$ {\color{red} $W$,$V$ and $F$}.

\item Backtracking: Start at $BF_{(n)}$ using the recurrences
 \[\begin{array}{rcl}
	BF_{(j)} &=& \left\{\begin{array}{rcl} L&\implies& BF_{(j-1)} \\ i &\implies& BF_{(i-1)} + BV_{(i,j)} \end{array} \right.\\
	\\
	BV_{(i,j)} &=& \color{red} \left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
		HL &\implies&\big< {\rm hairpin}(i,j) \big> \\
		IL &\implies& \big< {\rm stack}(i,j) \big> BV_{(i+1,j-1)} \\
		(i',j') &\implies& \big< \text{multi-loop from $(i,j)$ to }(i',j') \big> BV(i',j')\\
		k &\implies& BW_{(i+1,k)} BW_{(k+1,j-1)}
	\end{array}\right.\\
	\\
	BW_{(i,j)} &=& \color{red} \left\{\begin{array}{rcl}
	S & \implies & \big< bulge(i) \big> BW_{(i+1,j)} \\
	W & \implies & \big< bulge(j) \big> BW_{(i,j+1)} \\
	V &\implies& BV_{(i,j)} \\
	k &\implies& BW_{(i+1,k)} BW_{(k+1,j-1)}
	\end{array}\right.
\end{array}\]

\section{Implementation}
We denote by \textit{device} the computational device on which the processing of the DP matrix (or of a computational block) is done and $M_D$ its memory. This can be the GPU or the FPGA internal memory. Usually the main memory is larger than device memory and can ultimately be extended by either disk or network storage.
\subsection{Memory requirements}
We propose to evaluate the device memory requirements to solve the above problem classes. We need first to define additional problem properties related to implementation:\ul
\item \textbf{Number of matrices:} multiple matrices can be encoded as 1 matrix with multiple values per cell. Hence the implementation differentiates only between cost and backtrack matrices with respective element sizes $S_C$ and $S_B$.
\item \textbf{Delay of dependencies:} In case the problem does not fit into memory, partial matrix content needs to be transferred across sub-problems. Such data amount is usually proportional to the delay of dependencies. If this delay is small, it might be worth to duplicate matrix data in the wavefront, otherwise it might be more efficient to allow access to the previous computational blocks of the matrix.
\item \textbf{Wavefront size:} Finally some aggregation that is made along some dimension of the matrix does not need to be written at every cell but can be propagated and aggregated along with computation (ex: maximum along one row or column). Hence such information can be maintained in a single place (in the wavefront) and progress together with the computation. We denote by $S_W$ the size of wavefront elements.
\item \textbf{Input size:} the size of an input letter (from input alphabet) is denoted by $S_I$.
\ule

\subsection{Small problems (in-memory)}
Problem that can fit in memory can be solved in a single pass on the device. Such problem must satisfy the equation:
	\[(S_I+S_W) \cdot (m+n) + (S_C+S_B) \cdot (m\cdot n) \le M_D\]

For instance, assuming that $m=n$, $M_D=1024{\rm Mb}$, that backtrack is 2b (<16384, 3 directions) and that the cost can be represented on 4 b (int or float), that input is 1b (char) and that there is no wavefront, we can treat problems of size $n$ such that $2n+5n^2 \le 2^{30} \implies  n\le 14650$. We might also possibly need to take into account extra padding memory used for coalesced accesses. But it is reasonable to estimate that problems up to 14K fit in memory.

\subsection{Large problems}
To handle large problems, we need to split the matrix into blocks of size $B_H \times B_W$.

\subsubsection{Non-serial problems}
Non-serial problems need to potentially access all elements that have been previously computed. Assuming the restriction that dependencies are only along the rows and columns and that the serial dependencies delay is $\le$ than one block size, we need all the block on the same line and column and one in diagonal.

For simplification, let $m=n$, assume that we have $b$ rectangular block per row and per column. We need to transfer forth and back (in terms of blocks):
	\[b \cdot b +% computed line (once)
		(b-1) \cdot (b-1) + % diagonal block (1 per block)
		\sum_{i=0}^{b-1} i \cdot b % column blocks (for line i)
		= \tfrac{1}{2}b^2(b+5)-2b+1\]

With $b=8$ we have 401 block transfer (forth and back), which corresponds to transferring $12.5\times$ the whole matrix, and the problem size can now be (following the same formula and assertion as for small problems) $2n + 5 \cdot \big(  (n/b)^2 \cdot 2b \big) = 2n+10n^2/8 \le 2^{30} \implies n\le 29307$, so we roughly doubled matrix size at the cost of $12.5\times$ matrix transfer time plus indices overhead.

{\color{red} XXX: Do we want to support larger non-serial problem that do not fit in memory? Is it worth implementing ? Argue.}

\subsubsection{Serial problems}

{\color{red}
Split into blocks:\ul
\item Decide the shape of the blocks
\item Decide the size of the blocks
\item Decide of a strategy to store intermediate lines/columns: space/time tradeoff.
\ule

XXX: make it work up to 14K for all 3 problems using multiple kernels
XXX: example of non-symmetric serial problem

The three last elements, combined with the above one, provide a precise estimation of the memory consumption, and the implementation difficulty 

all the problem are subject to the input dimensions $n$.

the two latter one gives an estimation of the constant factor.

The delay of dependencies might also have an impact: if the matrix is too large to fit in the memory (device or main memory), it becomes necessary to maintain partial matrix content (all the intermediate elements) within the wavefront. Also the number of cost matrices might affect the performance, simply because maintaining them requires computations and memory accesses.
