/*** Implementation related notes ***/

Aka re-engineering todos to clean and refactor things

- trait Print should belong in LMS
- make people somehow know that they need to extend LiftVariables?
- x+2 : found Int, expecting Rep[Int]
- Rep[Unit] => Rep[X] : compiler complains with types
- getting a "proper" iterator implementation with next and
  hasNext
