I'm sending you a source package that I made last year for version
2.0.1. This version do not have the optimizations of the last paper
(Retrieving Smith-Waterman Alignments with Optimizations for Megabase
Biological Sequences using GPU. IEEE TPDS, 2012). I will soon release
the current version on source forge:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/cudalign/.

So, here is the instructions.

- extract the tar gz
- enter in directory ./project/src
- Edit Makefile and Change the paths. Maybe you will need to change
some flags and also some directories in the library paths in the
middle of the Makefile. My environments is for 64 bits.
- Maybe you will not be required to use the --compiler-bindir parameter
- Install libcairo2-dev in order to compile everything. If you cant
install cairo, I think you will need to remove libcairo support in the
source code (there is a #define to suppress the need of libcairo).
- After you compile the cudalign, enter in the ./newbench directory.
- You will need to download the sequences with the
prefetch_comparisons.pl script. The fasta files will be in the
"sequences" directory.
- You can run the comparisons using the run_comparison.pl script.
There is other scripts in the same directory.
- You can create new comparisons, with specific parameters, using the
create_comparison.pl script. The comparison files is stored in the
"comparison" directory.
- Type ../cudalign --help in order to see instruction for running
cudalign tool without the help of the scripts.
- Maybe, you will need to change CUDA parameters in the
common/cuda_configs.hpp file.
- If you need to change Smith Waterman parameters, edit common/sw_configs.hpp.

The scripts *.pl run without problem with me, but some problems may
happen if you try to run cudalign directly without the *.pl scripts.
There are many codes that are still in develpment, and some other
features are non functional yet.
Please, contact me if you have any problem.
