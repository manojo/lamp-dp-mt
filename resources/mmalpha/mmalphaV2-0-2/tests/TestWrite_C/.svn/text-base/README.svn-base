This directory has been created By T.Risset i on 25/01/95
it is used to test the Write_C program.
basically the operation to perform is :

Read_Alpha <file.Alpha | Write_C >file.c

This operations are written in the file test.exe


Present file:
cos3.alpha 	A program (SVD) from Sophie robert which uses sqrt
cosparam.alpha  A program (SVD) from Sophie robert which does not use sqrt
mat1.alpha	Classical matrix multiplication algorithm
mat2.alpha	matrix multiplication algorithm without input
pile.alpha	program with a if in RHS of assignement
test2.alpha     case with a union and constant 
test3.alpha*	3 branches case
test4.alpha*	negative constant
testsqrt.alpha  simple program with sqrt
