P. Quinton, April 2, 2005, then September 23, 2007

This directory results from the initial sources directory coming from the
MMAlpha forge, and modifications I tried to do in order to adapt it to 
Darwin. It was also modified on Sept. 23, 2007 in order to clean it and
make a documentation. The documentation is in doc/Developpers/Compiling. 

CONTENT (Sept. 23, 2007)

Not committed yet

*Makefile.config received a few modifications. Previously, the objects files
   for CODEGEN were named codegen.gen.o instead of gen.o now. Does it matter?
   Also, the PRETTYDIR was bound to Pretty, and now directly to Write_alpha. 
   I am not sure that it works... See log.
