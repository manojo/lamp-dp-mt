1.3 Added Multiple Assignment Code handling.

1.2 Bug fixes and coded added to handle non-convex domains.
    The program write_c was brought upto date with code_gen.
    Both use the same basic routines in gen.c
    Tests were added.

1.1 After do_substitution was called, the resulting domain
    needed to be resimplified, which was done by converting from
    node to domain back to node again.
    Ex: {t,j | j+1 <=t <= j+N; 1<=j<=N }
        context {t | t=2; N>=2 }
    after substitution:
    {t,j | j<=1; j>=1 }
    after simplification:
    {t,j | j=1 }
    Thus the need for simplification.
