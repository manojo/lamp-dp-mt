#   This is the makefile for the darwin system, i.e., MacOS X

#   Assumes that MMALPHA and OSTYPE are defined 

#   Call Makefile.config in sources/MakeIncludes
include ../MakeIncludes/Makefile.config

#   To compile Domlib, we need to know where the include files
#   and the lib files of the Polylib are. In this version, this
#   depends on how the Polylib was installed. 

#   Define Include files for Polylib. Should be changed
#POLYINCLUDE	= ${MMALPHA}/sources/Poly/${OSTYPE}/include
#   **** Was temporarily changed July 2007
#POLYINCLUDE	= ${MMALPHA}/sources/Poly/include

#   Defines where the library of POLYLIB is. Actually, this variable is the 
# same as LIBDIR defined in Makefile.config
POLYLIB-LIB	= $(LIBDIR)

# BINDIR and OBJDIR are already defined
#

DBG = "Y"

#   Flags for the C compiler. Assumes that PRECISIONFLAG and 
#   DEFINES have been defined in MakeIncludes/Makefile.${OSTYPE}
