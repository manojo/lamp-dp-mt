demo available (last modif 30/06/95 T.Risset)

INIT : This demo has been set for beginners, it details 
the basic MMAlpha commands (load, save, analyze)


In the NANA directory, are demo prepared for the Nana demo of the
29/06/95 in Leuven.  
	-MATVECT derivation of Alpha0 code and code for
	Madmacs from a system executing the matrix vector
	product. This demos can be used as a tutorial for
	transformation of alpha programs
	
	-SVD svd code in alpha written by sophie robert.
	This version uses the subsystems, inlining of subsystems,
	writing cnf code, writing C code, executing resulting C code. 
	The svd algorithm used takes as input a rectangualr matrix 
	and output a vector.

	-SVDUPDATE svd updating code written by sophie robert.
	uses the subsystem studied in the MATVECT demo. Same as SVD demo

	-VERIF Demos for verifying that the transformations performed
	in the MATVECT demo are valid. Show the uses of subsystems, and the 
	use of library of ALpha programs.

FIR : demo prepared for the ASAR project: derivation of Alpha0 code from 
Alpha code for the FIR (WARNING: at this date (05/09/96), this demo 
is not working any more).


SCHEDULE : demo showing how can be use the schedule[] function.


ZPOL : demo showing the use of the function defined for computations 
on Z-polyhedra in the Zpol.m package.


BINMULT : demo showing the complete synthesis of a bit-serial
          parameterized multiplier.
   Loads in a specification (in several systems), simulates it, serializes it,
   flattens it, schedules and space/time transforms it, and simulates again
   the resulting abstract systolic again.
   Details to be found in Florent de Dinechin's thesis.
 

Files to be kept (those which are not indented)

Some of the demo directories could be reused in some demos notebooks.
