Problems and modifications (April 30, 2005)

(Additional note (January 8, 2007). This file was written while creating
a version for Mac OS X with PowerPC. Now, with Intel processors, it would
be needed to recompile everything and put this in a binary file that
would be for example, bin.darwin-intel. This has to be done.)

I modified Makefile in order to compile Pretty which was added
to the distribution, otherwise, Write_Alpha does not compile.

When running make clean, there is an infinite loop, and the program stops
only for lack of resources. The problem appears whenever one of the target
directory does not exist. 

Another problem is that lib.darwin or lib.whatever, should be created 
manually. No rule is available either to remove them, nor to create them
(I guess). Therefore, these directories should be created or copied 
manually.

Makefile.linux and Makefile.darwin are very close, and only one of
them would be needed. The main difference is in the definition of
the position of mprep.

code_gen, read_alpha and write_alpha compile now normally. domlib also, 
but I know that the resulting binary does not work... pip does not 
compile yet.

Content (April 22, 2005)

Files with * should be examined for modifications

*d Code_Gen. Was checked. See README inside
*d Domlib. Was checked. See README inside
*d MakeIncludes. Was checked. See README inside
*Makefile  --> Different from Bigmess Makefile
*d MathLink. Was checked. No modification. But need to remove mathlink1 
inside, and not sure that this directory is useful.
*d Pip. Was checked. Makefile is different from version of MMAlphaBigmess, but
seems to be normal. New version contains piplib-1.3.3, which does not compile
on darwin
d Polylib. Was not checked yet. 
d Read_Alpha. Was checked. No modification
d Sed. Was checked. No modification
*d Write_Alpha. Was checked. Makefile was modified. See README inside
