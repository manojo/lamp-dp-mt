Directory naming conventions
----------------------------
New version: 15 Nov 1994

File hierarchy
--------------

Two main directories are used for alpha: ALPHA and ALPHA_BETA, sharing the
same internal structure. The modules under development will be
installed in ALPHA_BETA and developed in this directory until they are
bug-free.  All file names in all modules must be relative to the root of the
directory hierarchy of the distribution, stored in the environment variable
"MMALPHA".  In order to use the MmAlpha implementation of ALPHA, the user
has to set the value of this variable in his environment (see file
"How-to-install".)

The ALPHA file hierarchy is then:

udd/
 |
 |
 +--- alpha/
 | 	|
 |	+--- Mathematica/
 |      |
 | 	+--- centaur/
 |      |
 | 	...
 | 
 |
 +--- alpha_beta/
 |	|
...	+--- Mathematica/
	|
	...



In the Mathematica subdirectory ($MMALPHA) The files are split
into several directories. The different directories will be:

bin		executable binaries (parsers, external type-checkers ...)
man		user's guides to the different parts of the system
doc             reference documentation for the users or developers of ALPHA 
examples	examples, demos ...
lib		various library (Mma Package...)
sources		sources of all compiled modules/programs/documentations.
bugs		Repports on bugs found

   Subdirectories of this structure are as follows:

$MMALPHA/
 |
 +--- bin/			binaries (runable commands)
 |
 +--- man/			user's guide structured as standard Unix man.
 |
 +--- doc/			technical reference...
 |	|
 |	+-- developer/		...  for admin and developers only 
 |	|  			
 |	+-- user/		...  for users
 |	|
 |	+-- install/		... for installation (user/developper/admin)
 |	|
 |	+-- tutorial/		learning by example (to come REAL-SOON-NOW)
 |
 +--- examples/			the name says it all, a separate subdir for
 |	|			  each example
 |	|
 | 	+--- matprod/		matrix multiplication (what else?)
 |      |
 |     	...
 |	
 |
 +--- lib/			libraries, Mathematica packages and so on
 |	|
 |	+---Packages/		Mathematica packages in general
 |      |      |
 |	...    +--- Alpha/      MmAlpha packages
 |	       |      | 	  
 |             |      +--- Pprint.m	pretty-printer
 | 	       |      |
 | 	       |      +--- Visual.m	domain visualisation
 | 	       |      |
 | 	       |      +--- ...          coming soon ...
 | 	       |
 | 	       +--- Alpha.m	basic definitions package
 |	 
 +--- sources/			sources to all compiled parts of the
 |      |			  distribution; so there are
 |   	+--- bin/		sources of binaries
 |	|
 |	+--- doc/		sources of LaTeX/PostScript doc files
 |	|	
 |	+--- lib/		sources of compiled libraries
 |
 |
 +--- config/
 |	| 	       
 |	+--- setup.m		configuration file
 |	|
 |	+--- init.m		MmAlpha-wide default initializations	 
 |      |
 |      +--- emacs/		Emacs modes for running Mathematica and
 |      |       |  		editing Mathematica programs
 |	|	+-- lisp/		corresponding Emacs Lisp code
 |      |  
 |	+--- tex/		TeX/LaTeX styles and others (if needed)
 |             |
 |	       +--- macros/	Mostly the "unixman.sty" document style 
 |
 |
 +--- bugs/			shoud be empty


Symbol naming conventions
-------------------------

All symbols related to MmAlpha must appear in the context "Alpha`".
Subcontexts of "Alpha`" may be used to hold symbols peculiar to certain
particular applications (as the pretty-printer, see file
"$MMALPHA/lib/Mathematica/Pprint/MetaPprint.m".)
