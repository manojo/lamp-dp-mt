<h2>Writing a MMAlpha package</h2>
<P>
In order to obtain readable, maintainable, and safe code, 
some rules regarding the development of packages should be followed.
<br>
<ol>
<li>The package <b>must</b> but written along some conventions
which are best seen while reading this 
<a href="MyPackage.m">example</a>.
<li>The package <b>must</b> be delivered together with a test program which follows the testing strategy of MMAlpha. See 
<a href="../Writing-Tests/aboutTests.html">this</a> before writing the 
package. Indeed, testing starts at the same time as writing, since
the first tests are those who are used during development.
<li>The package <b>must</b> 
be delivered together with a documentation notebook. 
As we recommend developing packages directly from Mathematica 
notebooks, the initial development notebook is a good candidate 
to becomming a documentation notebook. 
See
<a href="Writing-Documentation/aboutDoc.html">this</a> to get more information.
