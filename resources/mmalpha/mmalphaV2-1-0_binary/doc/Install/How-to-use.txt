This file contains indications regarding the use of MMAlpha on 
Unix machine, provided that MMAlpha has been installed. This is
valid, for example, for Irisa users. 
				       
[user]	1. In the .cshrc file:
	   set the environment variable  MMALPHA to the MMALPHA directory 
	   (ask your admin where this directory is), by adding the command:
           setenv MMALPHA "..."
	   load the file $MMAlpha/init_user.csh by adding the command:
           source $MMALPHA/config/init_user.csh
	   The only files that should be edited by you are the
	   files of directory $MMALPHA/config/

[user]	2. copy  the  file "$MMALPHA/init.m" in your home directory 
	   (or append it to your $HOME/init.m file if it already 
	   exists). For users unfamiliar with Mathematica, recall
	   that the init.m file is executed whenever Mathematica
	   is launched.  

[user]	3. It's ready! Run Mathematica by the command:
           mathematica
	   and type "start[]" to launch the master notebook.
	   If you do not use the notebook interface, you will
	   not be able to visualize the notebook demos, but 
	   the system will work anyway.

[gnu-emacs user]
(This may not work...)
	3. Append the file "$MMALPHA/config/dot.emacs" to
	   your "$HOME/.emacs" file.

           If Emacs complains that it can't find the library named
	   "comint", get a copy of it from any emacs FTP site, and add
	   it to your standard Emacs-lisp directory.

	   Now, "M-x Mathematica" will start an interactive
	   Mathematica session from inside Emacs, and "M-x math-mode"
	   will put a buffer into Mathematica source _editing_ mode.
	   Also, an auto-mode feature is provided: when loading a file
	   with extension ".m", the buffer is automatically put in
	   "math-mode".

       			Installing MMALPHA on Linux system
***********************************************************************

The procedure is basically the same as for unix system except that
Linux often uses bash shell by default, hence replace "csh" by "bash"
in the above procedure.
