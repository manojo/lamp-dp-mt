This file contains MMAlpha installation instructions for Unix users,
Windows NT or XP users and Linux users.
				       
A more up-to-date (but less complete) version of this procedure can 
be found in the MMAlpha QuickStart document situated in $MMALPHA/doc/.

WARNING: YOU NEED 25 MBytes of DISK SPACE to run MMAlpha

***********************************************************************
       			Installing MMALPHA on Unix 
***********************************************************************

The table below gives the installation procedure. The "--- who ---"
field indicates who is to perform each operation: 'admin' (Alpha
account administator) and 'user' (any Alpha user, including
admins!). Each of them can be further specified when necessary (e.g.,
'gnu-emacs user').


--- who --- 			--- what to do ---

[admin]	0. De-archive the complete distribution in some directory, say
	"/home/group/name/" (a directory called alpha is created)
	by executing the install_tar script available at 
	http://www.irisa.fr/cosi/ALPHA/DOWNLOAD

[user]	1. In the .cshrc file:
           set the environment variable  MMALPHA
           to this directory (here /home/group/name/alpha)
           by the command:
           setenv MMALPHA "/home/group/name/alpha"
           load the file $MMAlpha/init_user.csh by the command:
           source $MMALPHA/config/init_user.csh
           The only files that should be edited by you are the
           files of directory $MMALPHA/config/

[user]	2. copy  the  file "$MMALPHA/init.m" to your home directory 
	   (or append it to your $HOME/init.m file if it already 
	   exists). For users unfamiliar with Mathematica, recall
	   that the init.m file is executed whenever Mathematica
	   is launched.  

[user]	3. It's ready! Run Mathematica by the command:
           mathematica
	   and type "start[]" to launch the master notebook.
	   If you do not use the notebook interface, you will
	   not be able to visualize the notebook demos, but 
	   the system will work anyway.

[gnu-emacs user]
	3. Append the file "$MMALPHA/config/dot.emacs" to
	   your "$HOME/.emacs" file.

           If Emacs complains that it can't find the library named
	   "comint", get a copy of it from any emacs FTP site, and add
	   it to your standard Emacs-lisp directory.

	   Now, "M-x Mathematica" will start an interactive
	   Mathematica session from inside Emacs, and "M-x math-mode"
	   will put a buffer into Mathematica source _editing_ mode.
	   Also, an auto-mode feature is provided: when loading a file
	   with extension ".m", the buffer is automatically put in
	   "math-mode".

***********************************************************************
       			Installing MMALPHA on Linux system
***********************************************************************

The procedure is basically the same as for unix system except that
Linux often uses bash shell by default, hence replace "csh" by "bash"
in the above procedure.

       			Installing MMALPHA on Windows NT or 
                                Windows XP

--- who --- 	--- what to do ---

[admin or you]		
       1  Get the MMAlpha.exe file at url:
          http://www.irisa.fr/cosi/ALPHA/DOWNLOAD
          Execute this file and answer the questions (essentially you
	  have to indicate where you want MMAlpha to be installed).


[user]2	  Set the environment variables. (Note: if you have installed 
	  MMAlpha by yourself - step1 - these may already be set by the 
	  installation procedure).
	  - Open the system configuration panel (start->configuration
	  panel)
          - Double click on the "System" icons,
	  - Choose the Advance panel
	  - Click on Environment variables
          - Consider the user variable panel (top part)
          - Create a MMALPHA variable whose value is the directory where
	  MMAlpha is installed. Typically, it should be C:\...\MMAlpha. 
	  To create a variable, click on New, and fill 
	  the name and value. This step allows Mathematica to know
	  where MMAlpha is located.
	  - append ;%MMALPHA%\bin.cygwin32 to the user Path environment 
	  variable. To do so, select the Path variable, click Modify, 
	  place the cursor at the end of the string and type 
	  ;%MMALPHA%\bin.cygwin32 . This step allows the Domlib library
	  to be launched.
		
[user] 3  Copy in the $HomeDirectory of Mathematica the file 
	  init.m which is in directory $MMALPHA/config/
	  The home directory of Mathematica depends on your system.
	  To know it, start Mathematica and evaluate the variable
	  $HomeDirectory. In Windows NT, this is your C: directory,
	  but in Windows XP it is somewhere in your Document and Setting
	  directory.
	  This file is executed by Mathematica whenever it is started.
	  Its execution calls another init file located in the 
	  MMAlpha distribution. 

[user] 4  It's ready! Start Mathematica. The first evaluation in 
	  the initial notebook should start MMAlpha. Normally, the
	  Messages window of Mathematica opens and contains a few
	  lines indicating that MMAlpha was started successfully.
	  Evaluate start[] in any notebook to launch the master 
	  notebook of MMAlpha.
