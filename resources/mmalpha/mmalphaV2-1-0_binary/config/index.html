The configuration directory</H1> 
<hr>
<A HREF="../index.html">Up! (welcome directory)</A>
<hr>
<P> 
This directory contains files and information needed
to install MMAlpha. More information is available
<A HREF="../doc/Install/Doc-How-to-install.pdf">here</A>
(mirrored in Appendix E of the
<A HREF="../doc/QuickStart/AlphaStart.pdf">QuickStart document</A>.)

<h2>Installation</h2>
The <A HREF="init.m">init.m</A> file must be either called by your own init.m
file when you start MMAlpha
or copied in your base directory. 
<p>
A few words of explanations. When 
you start Mathematica (on any system), Mathematica executes the
file named init.m which is present in a directory
called the base directory, at
least, if such a file exists. 
The address of this directory, which depends on your
operating system, is obtained by evaluating the variable
$UserBaseDirectory in Mathematica. 
<p>
To run MMAlpha, you should write such an init.m 
file and put it in your base directory. This file could contain, 
at least:
<br>
<b>
Get[ Environment["MMALPHA"]<>"/config/init.m" ] ; 
<br>
</b>
which will read the init.m file contained in this directory.
You could also add here additional Mathematica instructions. 
For example, the following
<b>
<br>
$myNotebooks = ".../myNotebooks";
<br>
$myMasterNotebook = "myMaster.nb";
<br>
</b>
that would
set the MMAlpha variables <b>$myNotebooks</b> and <b>$myMasterNotebook</b>
which are used to indicate to MMAlpha where your own notebooks and 
your master notebook are located (see explanations in the 
master notebook of MMAlpha, in section More).
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
If you cannot start MMAlpha, check the following.
<ul>
<li>Start Mathematica, and look in the Messages* window. 
Normally, the content of this window should
look like 
<a href="tbs.txt">this.</a>
<li>If it does not, this means that MMAlpha has not
been properly installed.
<pr>
Check that your environment variable $MMALPHA has
been set properly. This variable must contain the 
path of the MMAlpha directory. On Unix or Linux, it
is set using a setenv command. On Windows NT, it is
set by opening the System Windows in the Configuration
Pannel, then Advanced, then Environment Variables, and 
setting the MMALPHA variable (all this is described in 
the MMALPHA home page.)
<li>If you are desperate, send a mail to the alpha team...
